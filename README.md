 ## Palindrome

A palindrome is a string that forms the same word if it is reversed. For example, "abba" is a palindrome because it reads the same backwards and forwards. "Madam, I'm Adam" is also a palindrome if you ignore capitalization and punctuation.

This JavaScript function takes a string as input and returns `true` if the string is a palindrome, or `false` if it is not.

```js
function palindrome(str) {
  return str.split("").every((char, i) => {
    return char === str[str.length - i - 1];
  });
}
```

The `split()` method converts the string into an array of characters. The `every()` method iterates over the array and returns `true` if all of the characters are equal to their corresponding characters in the reversed string. If any of the characters are not equal, the `every()` method returns `false`.

## Reverse String

This JavaScript function takes a string as input and returns a new string with the reversed order of characters.

```js
function reverse(str) {
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}
```

The `split()` method converts the string into an array of characters. The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the characters in the array. The `join()` method converts the array back into a string.

## Conclusion

These two functions are examples of how to use JavaScript to manipulate strings. The palindrome function can be used to check if a string is a palindrome, and the reverse function can be used to reverse the order of characters in a string.
